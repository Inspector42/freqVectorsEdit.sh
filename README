SYNOPSIS

freqVectorsEdit [ -bhmk ] [ -show ]


DESCRIPTION


	freqVectorsEdit.sh is a bash script to add/replace FrequencyVectors in plists in
	X86PlatformPlugin.kext/Contents/Resources/
	This kext can be found in: /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns

	The target plist (example: Mac-F60DEB81FF30ACF6.plist for the MacPro6,1) is selected based on the used board-id.

	In the current version, the following options are available

	The following options are available:


	-b 	board-id (example: Mac-F60DEB81FF30ACF6)
		Overrides the board-id obtained from the system settings in case the editing it performed on a 3rd computer
		default: board-id of current running systems specified in SMBIOS settings

	-d	debug
		0 = no debug output (default)
		1 = debug output (very verbose)
	
	-m	model (example: MacPro6,1)
		Overrides the model obtained from the system settings

 	-show	show supported board-id and model combinations
          	Haswell
		Broadwell
		Skylake
		KabyLake

	-k	kext path (example: /System/Library/Extensions)
        	Overrides path to kernel extension to allow editing of frequency vectors with SIP enabled
		This will of course require further processing but comes in handy if resulting patched plist is used
		for CPUFriend
